## Task 1: Topic modeling the Blog Authorship Corpus

The [blog authorship corpus](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm) consists of the collected posts of 19,320 bloggers gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. The corpus is available in an xml format that contains tags about age and gender of the blog author. 

I parsed out only those spanning over 500 words giving me a total of 2,49,844 male blogs and 2,54,879 female blogs, out of which I chose 50,000 for either of the genders. The code for parsing can be found [here](https://github.com/Saurav0074/Gender-Classification-of-Blog-Author/blob/master/parse_xml.py). This task leverages two algorithms to observe the relevant topics prevailing in the blogs written by both the genders:

* [lda.py](https://github.com/Saurav0074/100daysOfMLCode/blob/master/blog_topic_modeling/code/lda.py) uses the gensim and mallet's implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) along with the code for the optimal number of topics on gensim's classical LDA based upon their coherence scores.
* [nmf.py](https://github.com/Saurav0074/100daysOfMLCode/blob/master/blog_topic_modeling/code/nmf.py) uses scikit-learn's implementation of the Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) alogirthm. 

Here is a plot showing that the coherence score is maximum for 60 topics on the female blog corpus:

Below are few interesting results showing top 10 words for each such topic, others can be found in [blog_topics.txt](https://github.com/Saurav0074/100daysOfMLCode/blob/master/blog_topic_modeling/outputs/blog_topics.txt):

### 1.  Using LDA: 

The float values indicate the contribution of each word to the overall topic.

**Female blogs:**

### 2. Using NMF:

**Female blogs**

`Topic 0:
pron hand mother mom family eye sister mind parent name
Topic 1:
urllink female http bring com www link bear site page
Topic 2:
go home today fun back come house mom pron tomorrow
Topic 12:
say ask tell word mean something anything hear nothing give
Topic 13:
night last sleep dream morning wake bed hour week saturday
`

**Male blogs**

`Topic 0:
pron eye mind name hand mom dad parent face brother
Topic 1:
urllink article link male read news check picture find photo
Topic 3:
bush kerry vote president republican election campaign george party administration
Topic 6:
game play team win player score lose ball football hit
Topic 10:
comment full post male urllink leave make thank box add
`

A closer analysis may reveal trends similar to that mentioned in [1], i.e. female topics show more frequent occurrences of emotionally intensive adverbs and ajectives, acronyms, etc. while male topics are more biased towards politics, games and religion. Just to mention, these are all generic analysis done for fun.

The words in each topic can be analysed individually as well to infer what they are actually taking about. For example, `(game play team win player score lose ball football hit)` clearly indicates about a football match while `(urllink article link male read news check picture find photo)` could be about a website that posts news.

Further, the topics generated by the NMF model seem to make more sense than that of those from LDA, which seems plausible given the smaller data set size.[2]
